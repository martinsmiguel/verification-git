# Verification git
### Checking my git

##### TEST 1 `Fail`
I tryed clone, change the README.md and push origin master repository on github.

##### TEST 2 `It worked`
I searched on google `ERROR: Permission to .git denied to user`. I accessed to stackoverflow, and saw an answer about `Credentials from the Windows`. I followed the steps and it worked.
